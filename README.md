# Sign Language Translator  
This is a two part project. The first part will be developing the model (delivered); The second part will be developing a website so that user can use the model (not deliver).  
## Introduction
I developed a deep learning model with Python and Tensorflow to interpret sign language using Convolutional Neural Network - 2 convolutional layers, 1 regular layer, and 1 ouput layer. The model is trained on 8000 samples, and then validated with a different dataset, achieving more than 90% accuracy.
